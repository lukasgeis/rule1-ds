# DominatingSet Rule1 Reduction

This is a minimalist fork of our more extensive implementation in the [PaceYourself](https://github.com/manpen/pace25/tree/master) solver.
Please refer to the PaceYourself-Version for a stronger and more efficient implementation.

See the original formuation of this reduction-rule in \[OriginalRule1\] and \[LinearRule1\] for our improved version.
